point_drawing
=============

This is a desktop application for drawing, animating, and generating shapes

requirements
=============

This is building on my XUbuntu 12.0.4 x64 machine with Qt Creator 3.2.2 (opensource), Based on Qt 5.3.2 (GCC 4.6.1, 64 bit).

TODOs
=============

1) Make the animation centered in the widget, and make it be more visible
2) Add a mainwindow and have the display widget take up the top 2/3's, with a configuration panel on the bottom
3) add in complex shapes (such as 4 petal flowers)
4) add in support for reading in points from a file
5) (LARGE) implement a regression algorithm to match up points from a file to a geometry that can be generated by varying inputs(i.e. find the size of the average circle, find rectangular width/height/offsets that come closest to inputs), this should be extensible to 3d
6) (LARGE) add in opengl widget support for a 3d view of geometries
6a) add in mouse controls
6b) add in 3d geometry generation
7) performance improvements to make the animation faster (60fps?)
7a) improve regressions for 3d cases so it can happen on an embedded system
